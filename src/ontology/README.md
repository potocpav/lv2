All the Rust source files in this directory were automatically generated
using the `rome` crate like this:

```rust
cargo run --example generate_code -- --mod ontology ../lv2/src/ontology ../lv2/ontology/*.ttl
```

This fork was used: `https://github.com/potocpav/rome`. Some details about
the local changes to the `ttl` files are in `ontology/README.md`.
